# Hola

My name is Ghersi, and I'm currently a sophomore at the University of Connecticut pursuing a CSE degree. Sometimes I code for fun and can go weeks with constant stuff to do, and other times I don't even think about coding for months, but that's mostly summer. 

## Languages I'm confident with
  * Python: Learned Python in CSE 2050, a class about data structures and algorithms. Used it for a lot of small side projects and assignments, and I still use it now for other classes and their coding assignments.
  * Javascript/Typescript: Learned js/ts for side projects. Have only used them for scripting and working with some APIs, but have been learning React for the past month or two, so hopefully I'll be adding some frontend work to my repos.

## Languages I'm learning or have learned in school
  * Scheme: A functional programming language I learned in CSE 1729 my first year. Only used the language for class and its assignments, but shouldn't be hard to pick back up if needed.
  * C: Learned C as part of a systems programming class. Languages is dangerously simple as many say, and memory can easily be mismanaged with it. 
  * RISC-V Assembly: Learned RISC-V as part of a computer architecture class. This language is like C, but not designed for humans to read. If you use assembly daily, I commend you, but I'd rather go mismanage memory with C than with this.
  * Java: Learned Java during my junior year of high school as part of AP Computer Science A. Have used this language a few times since, but not for much. Once again, shouldn't be hard to pick back up if needed.

## Languages I might have picked up at some point but never did anything with
  * HTML/CSS: HTML is easy enough to use, but currently working on learning the basics of CSS as I'm learning React and basic frontend work. 
  * SQL: Went through W3 school course for SQL, but haven't used it for anything ever.
  * Maybe theres more random languages that I used along the way for something that I forgot about. Will add more as time passes. 

## That's it for now. Will keep updating whenever I have more to add.
