# Hola

My name is Ghersi, and I'm currently a sophomore at the University of Connecticut pursuing a CSE degree. Sometimes I code for fun and can go weeks with constant stuff to do, and other times I don't even think about coding for months, but that's mostly summer. 

## Languages I'm best at
  * Python: Learned Python in CSE 2050, a class about data structures and algorithms. Used it for a lot of small side projects and assignments, and I still use it now for other classes and their coding assignments.

## Languages I'm learning or have learned in school
  * Scheme: A functional programming language I learned in CSE 1729 my first year. Not a big fan of functional programming only because I always forget some parenthesis somewhere. Only used the language for class and its assignments, but shouldn't be hard to pick back up if needed.
  * C: Currently learning C as part of CSE 3100, systems programming. Languages is dangerously simple as many say, and memory can easily be mismanaged with it. 
  * RISC-V Assembly: Currently learning this as part of CSE 3666, introduction to computer architecture. This language is like C, but not designed for humans to read. If you use assembly daily, I commend you, but I'd rather go mismanage memory with C than with this.
  * Java: Learned Java during my junior year of high school as part of AP Computer Science A. Have used this language a few times since, but not for much. Once again, shouldn't be hard to pick back up if needed

## Languages I might have picked up at some point but never did anything with
  * Javascript: Have used js for some discord.js. Used some some node.js at some point, but used it so little that I don't even remember when. Tried web dev at some point, but never went far enough with it to make an actual site. Js syntax shouldn't be hard to pick up if I ever needed it for anything serious.
  * HTML/CSS: Same as above, used at some point for some web skeleton, but nothing functional.
  * SQL: Went through W3 school course for SQL, but haven't used it for anything ever.
  * Maybe theres more random languages that I used along the way for something that I forgot about. Will add more as time passes. 

That's it, kthxbai.
